# CubePermutations
Python script to calculate the number of possible cominations of any size rubiks cube.

If you want to be able to say these numbers use http://www.isthe.com/cgi-bin/chongo/number.cgi to convert them to english names.

Currently I have added cubes and megaminxes.

I am uncertain for even sized megaminxes such as master/elite kilominx, if you believe the outputs to be incorrect contact me on discord CometAurora#1600
